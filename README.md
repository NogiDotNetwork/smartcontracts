# KCC.Social Smart Contracts

The KCC.Social NFT system is made up out of 3 distinct smart contracts.

- A store interface, which handles taking payments in different currencies (and calculating the prices appropriately).
- The ERC-1155 NFT itself, which utilises signature checking to require mints to go through the KCC.Social backend to handle special mint requirements.
- A token distributor, which publicly handles the payouts between our team and external collaborators, to guarantee fair and safe payments.
